# Preorder BinaryTree

This program builds a binary tree (using pointers) from a string of characters

and prints out the binary tree in preorder, inorder, postorder and level-order.

The input string is a preorder order representation of a binary tree. 

In particular, a dot/period signifies an empty subtree in that branch. 

Then, the function IsBST to determine whether the binary tree built is a

binary search tree or not.
